# Python & It's libraries

-This week we will start by learning about Python language and libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib which are extensively used in Machine Learning and Data Analysis domains.
-Basic idea is to familiarise yourself with power and utlities of these libraries.
-Like most part of this project, This week will be based on hands-on-experience code because we believe that some intuitions are best developed via trial and error, tweaking the code in small ways and observing the results.

Using online python environments like [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is encouraged.

Python is a great general-purpose programming language on its own, but with the help of a few popular libraries it becomes a powerful environment for scientific computing.

This week has the following content:

### Python
1. [Getting Started](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/google_colab/google_colab_introduction.htm): Familiarisation with Google Colab. No need to give a full read but Use it as a guide when you get stuck. Other Resources: [Quick Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KeJZBZGtYo) (a must watch to get started)
2. [Data types](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-data-types/): Pretty basic stuff, Read as per convienince. Other References: [Numeric](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_numbers.asp) | [Strings](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp) | [Boolean](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_booleans.asp) | [List](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp) | [Tuples](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp) | [Set](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets.asp) | [Dictionary](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp) |
